                    <p> You probably shouldn't grow your own weed. Don't get me wrong, it's a very rewarding experience. 
                        But there's a fair bit of work involved and you're going to have to spend some money to get started. You'll need a bit 
                        of space. Patience will be your only real ally, and you'll have to sort through a lot of incomplete information when 
                        you're looking for answers. Your plants will get sick, some of them will die. And that great smoke that you just can't 
                        wait to light up, well, let's just say that it's probably not gonna happen in a few weeks. Or months. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There are so many good reasons why you should just buy your bud from your guy or the dispensary or anywhere else EXCEPT your own,
                        homegrown stock. Your plants will get sick. They WILL get sick. What sickness, pray tell? Every sickness imaginable. And
                        there are plenty of them. From nutrient dificiencies to tiny little SPIDER MITES (yep, spider mites. Why spiders, you ask?
                        Because they have 8 legs!) to everything else like leaf blight (leaf septoria), problems with your water and probably a lot
                        of other things that I've never even experienced yet. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Feel like solving some of those problems? Great! But before you begin, remember that this plant has been illegal for quite some
                        time, so while we were solving horticultural problems and modernizing our techniques for crop growth and sustainability as a society,
                        your best bet for knowledge about weed is literally a book by uncle Jorge that is a compilation of a lot of first hand (subjective) 
                        knowledge, and a whole heck of a lot of anecdotal information. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It's not about whether or not you have a knack for it. Different forms of life require different types of care. If you've 
                        cared for plants in the past, you'll have a bit of a headstart. But there is still going to be a lot to learn. And 
                        most of that learning is going to be done through trial and error. It's not that there aren't answers out there, but you're
                        going to need to understand the life cycle of the cannabis plant in order to give her the care she needs so that she can 
                        give you those frosty buds. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On the other hand, being there for the birth and growth of your plants, watching those tricomes develop, seeing them grow so
                        quickly and beautifully... well, if you're still with me, I'll give you a few tips so that you don't immediately kill your 
                        plants. If you can fit it into your budget, buy Marijuana Horticulture by Jorge Cervantes. And read it.

                    <p>As is the case with many worthwhile things in life, we begin with some questions. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is your budget?</li>
                                <p class="li-detail">This is an important one. Your budget will determine which type of grow is feasible for your first
                                time around. At minimum you can probably expect to shell out several hundred dollars if you want to have a shot at
                                some decent bud. If you want to get fancy, you could probably spend a grand or two.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Budget whatever amount is comfortable to you, but keep in mind that even under good circumstances it will likely be half
                                a year or more before you are able to enjoy the fruit of your investment. 
                                <br><br>
                                For our purposes, we are going to try to spend the least amount possible to get you growing some solid nugs.
                            <li>How much space do you have?</li>
                                <p class="li-detail">
                                    At minimum you're going to need an area that is 2 feet by 2 feet, with at least 6 feet of ceiling height. Depending
                                    on what and how you would like to grow, you might want a bit more room than that. <br><br>
                                    
                                    If you live in Illinois, for example, you're allowed to grow at home if you are a medical card holder. One requirement 
                                    is that you must cultivate in a room that can be locked and is inaccessible to the public. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Pick a spot you can use for six months.
                                </p>
                            <li>How many plants do you want to grow?</li>
                                <p>In the United States, there are limits to how many plants you can grow in many of the states that have decriminalized or legalized pot. Do your
                                    own research and make sure you're sure before you begin. In Illinois, medical card holders may cultivate five plants that
                                    are over five inches tall. You can either cultivate five at a time from clone or seed to harvest, or you can keep a mother plant and have 
                                    four plants perpetually in the flowering stage. We'll get into that in a bit.
                                </p>
                                
                                <br>
                                
                                <p>You know, this is pretty complicated. Maybe it would be better if you just watched some TV instead.</p>

                    <header>A few words about water</header>
                    
                    <p>Unless you have a particular fetish or phobia where water is concerned, you probably haven't spent
                        that much time thinking about it. Maybe you drink bottled water, or have a filter to take out all
                        the nasty bits. Maybe you've dug a little deeper and decided that you don't like flouride or 
                        chlorine or some other chemical that's been added to stabilize your city water. <br><br>
                        Maybe you live in Flint, Michigan, and all you can think about is water. Or maybe you live at the
                        beach and all you can see is water, but you can't really drink all that much of it. <br><br>
                        Well, none of that really matters. I mean, there is something to be said for drinking the right
                        kind of water and eating the right kind of food. But that's not why we're here. As much as you 
                        may be messing with your own internal chemistry, you have no idea what you are doing to your poor
                        plants when you give them the wrong type of water. What is the wrong type, you ask? That's a really 
                        good question, actually. I wish I had asked that question
                        before I ever set out upon my ultimately peril-fraught journey of cultivating cannabis. <br><br>
                        Not all water was created equal. There are three basic things that you will have to learn to
                        measure and alter if you have any prayer of becoming a "green thumb":
                    </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>PH</li>
                                <li>EC (Electric Conducivity) or TDS PPM (Total Dissolved Solids Parts Per Million)</li>
                                <li>Tempurature</li>
                            </ol>
                    <p>
                        People will tell you many things regarding the preceding three items. People will lie to you.
                        The internet will tell you many things as well, and the internet will lie to you as well. I will
                        tell you a few things, and I'll try to be as honest as possible. But hey, let's face it, I'll 
                        probably lie to you as well. If your parents lied to you when you were young and told you that
                        you would do great things with your life, who am I to tell you otherwise?<br><br>
                        I know, I know. You didn't come here to read about your crappy life. You came here so that I
                        could talk you out of growing your own weed. Well, you've come to the right place. Water is
                        another very good reason why you should't grow your own bud. Why? Well, you see those points
                        we enumerated? I wish I could tell you there was an easy, cheap way to find out if your water
                        is worth giving to your plants. But there isn't. You're going to have to spend a minimum of $200
                        dollars on a decent meter, just to keep from killing your plants. People will tell you that you 
                        can spend less. The internet will tell you that you can spend less. But yep, you guessed it. They 
                        would both be lying. 
                        To be fair, you could probably get a TDS meter that could sorta work for less than a hundy, but 
                        I wouldn't recommend it. Consider that your plants will not survive or thrive if you do not give
                        them the water they need in the ranges that they need.<br><br>
                        I could go into a lot more detail here, talking about what sort of meter to buy, what sort of
                        values to look for, what kind of water you need, but what's the point? You probably wouldn't 
                        understand me at this point anyway. If you take anything away from this section, it should be 
                        that water is everything to your plant, yours probably sucks, and making it better is going to
                        cost you. A lot.

                    <header>Lighting</header>
                    
                    <p>This may surprise you, but plants need light to grow. The type and wattage of your lights will
                        have a not inconsiderable effect on how quickly your plants grow and the potency of your crop.<br><br>
                        This is another reason why you shouldn't grow your own weed. If you thought the whole water
                        thing was a lot of money, wait until you start to buy lighting. Even if you find the right kind of
                        lighting for the right price, you're going to continue to pay for that light every single day of your
                        plants' lives. This is one of the big reasons some individuals choose to do their growing outdoors: 
                        you've got a big ball of light in the sky that appears every day at a convenient time and disappears
                        just as conveniently.<br><br>
                        If you can't harness those magical sunbeams, you're going to have to give your plants another light
                        source. Have you ever tried to raise a houseplant like basil or orchids, only to find that they grew
                        slowly and sadly? You're not alone. Even if this has never happened to any other person on the face
                        of the planet, it has happened to yours truly, the author of this here site. So many happy little 
                        plants came through my door, only to grow sad and depressed once the reality of their living conditions
                        set it. I tried. Oh lord, how I tried! I watered them, put them ALMOST directly underneath (though at
                        a respectable distance of at least five feet) one of the 40 watt energy saver bulbs that I have 
                        attempting to brighten up my kitchen. What do you mean that's not enough? What does that even mean?<br><br>
                        As it turns out, plants need more light than that. How much more? Well, remember what we were saying
                        about the Sun? Plants are used to getting light on an order of magnitude somewhere thereabouts, with 
                        all of the color spectrums, heat and intensity that come with it. Trying to feed my basil plant with
                        my puny little kitchen light bulb was like trying to feed my teenage son with scraps left over after
                        his pet rabbit finishes eating: there may be some sort of nutrient content there, but nothing worthwhile.<br><br>
                        Plan on spending another couple hundred dollars AT LEAST on lighting, and a solid twenty to fifty per
                        month feeding your plants those luscious lumens. That is to say, feeding them through their leaves. Feeding
                        them through the roots is something we'll cover in the next section. <br><br>
                        Depending on how you answered question number one above, you'll have to decide what sort of lighting
                        is right for you, although they all probably even out in the end. LEDs are a bigger initial investment, 
                        but cheaper to run, and the HID and HPS lights are cheaper in the beginning and cost more to run. Whichever 
                        you choose, get something big and bright. <br><br>
                        Did I mention that you're going to have to deal with the heat some of these light types give off? Get ready for some fun.

                    <p>Are you sure you want to do this? If you embark on this journey, you will have to pay more attention to 
                        what your plants eat than you have likely ever paid to what you yourself eat. Although an added bonus
                        of learning a bit of horticulture is that you will see the effect environmental factors have on your 
                        plants, which may give you some insight into how your body functions and what could help it to work 
                        better. But I digress.<br><br>
                        If you're expecting me to give you some specific information on what to feed the plants, I'm afraid
                        you're out of luck. Part of your journey, should you wish to continue to canoe down this canal, will 
                        be to learn how to research and troubleshoot the different aspects of raising some healthy ladies. <br><br>
                        There may be a few things I can help you out with. To begin with, remember how I said that water is 
                        a really important part of all of this? If you check your water with a TDS meter, you can see the amount
                        of Total Dissolved Solids, measured in PPM, or Parts Per Million. This means whatever is in there: dirt,
                        chemicals, whatever. When you add fertilizer to your water, this increases the amount of TDS in the water. 
                        If your water already has too many dissolved solids, these will saturate your roots and they won't be able
                        to absorb the nutrients. Either filter your water or get a water distiller if your water's dissolved 
                        solids come in at anything more than 75-100 PPM.So that's one issue that you have to resolve.  Which is 
                        going to cost you even MORE money. Then it will cost you electricity to run
                        it. If you go the distilled water route, you're going to have to add even more 
                        stuff to your water (such as calcium and magnesium), so be prepared.<br><br>

                    <p>There are way too many choices. This fact alone should dissuade you from becoming a cultivator. Ever
                        heard of decision fatigue? You're gonna have to make a lot of decisions. Choosing growing medium
                        that fits your needs will save you headaches down the line. Each one has its pros and cons, and I'm not an expert, 
                        so I won't try to sell you on any one in particular. <br><br>
                        What I can tell you is that I tried soiless and aeroponics for my first grows, and it was not a carefree
                        experience. Maybe I could have researched a bit more before diving in, but a particularity of those two
                        types of cultivation is that you need to have a deeper understanding of water and nutrients. It's not 
                        even that complicated. Maybe I'm just dense, but I had a rough time my first year. Good, organic soil 
                        is much more stable, so using that medium for your first grow will allow you learn a bit with your 
                        first plants without committing herbicide.

                    <p>If you're growing indoors, you have the possibility to control almost all of the environmental variables. 
                        You can achieve this dominion over your inner space in whatever way works best for you and your house.
                        You're going to want to have an area that you can use exclusively for that, with the possibility to create 
                        and regulate airflow and lighting. A grow tent can be a convenient and relatively inexpensive way to accomplish this. 
                        If you have the space, pick up one that is four feet wide by four feet wide, and six feet or more in height. 
                        That should be about enough space to take one set of plants from seed or clone to harvest. <br><br>
                        If odor is a factor, pick up an activated carbon filter to neutralize the aroma. Coupled with some sort of
                        turbine exhaust fan you should be golden. Until it gets too hot. Then you're screwed. So yeah, plenty to
                        worry about.

                    <p>Depending on where you live, your options may be limited as far as obtaining cannabis clones. If this is the 
                        case, you're going to have to start from seed. A purchase for an economical grow might look something like this:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Seeds</li>

                            <li>Something to improve your water, like a distiller or reverse osmosis filter system</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The good news is, there are a lot of resources on the internet that you can learn from. The bad news is, a lot 
                            of that information is anecdotal at best, or bad science at worst. That doesn't mean you won't find a lot of useful things. 
                            But the application of those things will be more difficult without context. Not to discourage you, but you really should 
                            try something that's easier to grow and harder to kill... like your credit card debt! It will probably be less of 
                            a headache in the end.<br><br>
                            If you must try, a simple process may look something like this:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Buy some seeds</li>
                            <li>Germinate them</li>
                            <li>Allow the seedings to grow until they are ready to move to a larger container, feeding one quarter strength nutrients</li>
                            <li>Move seedlings to a larger container</li>
                            <li>Feed at half strength until plants are ready for larger containers</li>
                            <li>Move to larger containers</li>
                            <li>Gradually begin a stronger feeding regimen</li>
                            <li>If not in final container, move plants to larger container when ready</li>
                            <li>When plants are ready, begin flowering phase (change lighting to 12/12 light/dark schedule)</li>
                            <li>Feed them flowering nutrients according to recommended specs</li>
                        </ol>

                        We'll talk about when to harvest them in the next section. If you've come this far, you're probably realizing why you never 
                        should have done this crap in the first place. But hey, here we are, so may as well finish.

                    <header>Time to harvest</header>

                    <p>When you harvest your weed will have an important impact on the quality. Again, part of this is subjective because it will 
                        depend on what you are looking for. There are people that grow cannabis so that they can smoke it and get "high". If that is
                        your goal, you will want to pay careful attention to the timing of your harvest, and how you care for your plants in the 
                        moments leading up to that fateful cut. <br><br>
                        If you don't know what trichomes are, don't worry. Neither do I. But if you look at your buds through a jeweler's 30x microscope, 
                        you will see some little balls that are standing on little towers. I'm not even sure if the scientific world has identified 
                        these wonderful little buggers, but I'm convinced that this is the real source of the "high", not these so-called trichomes or 
                        whatever. Now, the wonderful thing about these little balls is that they start out clear as your conscience was on the day 
                        you were born. Then, they begin to experience life, with you. If your energy is perfect, then those little crystal balls will 
                        never lose their luster. But if you, like so many of the denizens of this plane, have a soul that is less than pure, you will 
                        see them start to get sorta cloudy. If you see that happen (and you should check at least every couple of days as the buds start to 
                        get big), then your harvest is approaching.<br><br>
                        Jorge Cervantes says in his book that you should stop feeding nutrients to plants at around seven to ten days before harvest. 
                        On the interweb, you may find other opinions that contradict his. Or others that support it. This is why you shouldn't grow 
                        weed. You can't even figure out to harvest it. But if it's there with cloudy little balls on cloudy little spires, then you 
                        may as well do your best to harvest it.<br><br>
                        There are a few options when it comes time to harvest, so I'm gonna let you figure that out on your own. Cut those buds however
                        you best decide and get them started drying. Dry them in a dark room that isn't too humid or too dry. Another problem to solve!

                    <p>If you are going to smoke your weed, then please have the decency to cure it properly. You thought you could smoke it, now 
                        that it's nice and dry? Nope. Not yet. Now it needs to finish drying out and releasing all of the bad things and evenly 
                        distributing all of the things that make you feel "high". This process could (but probably won't) take you three weeks. More 
                        likely, it will take you two or three months, if you want to see what sort of potential your weed really has, instead of 
                        using it up early like your parents did with you. This means keeping it at at sixty to sixty five percent relative humidity, 
                        in the dark, in a cool place, and NOT SMOKING IT. I repeat, you will not cure your weed properly IF YOU SMOKE ALL OF IT. Let me 
                        tell you a sad story. Bob planted three plants, with seeds he obtained from a faraway land. They grew into majestic, beautiful 
                        ladies, who in turn gifted Bob with some great nugs. Bob was so excited, he dried the nugs, and swore to himself that he would 
                        only smoke a tiny bit before curing them, just to try. He ground one up and put a bit in his pipe... and coughed so hard he 
                        almost lost what small pieces he had left of his soul. He waited, and the "high" that he felt was underwhelming and soon ended. 
                        He felt disappointed, as if his beauties had somehow failed him. He resolved to wait, to allow the transformation of his stash 
                        to be complete. He waited... two days. He couldn't resist. He opened the jar and grabbed another nug. This time, he rolled a 
                        joint. It would be better, he knew. He lit it up and... it was worse than the dime bag crap he'd bought off that guy at the gas 
                        station. And so it went, little by little, until Bob had completely depleted his stash, never having sampled the true fruits 
                        of his months of labor. Months! Bob was so disappointed that he never again planted a seed, wishing only to subsist off of the 
                        poorly cured pot he got from his neighbor. Don't be like Bob. Cure your weed. For the love of all that is sane, cure your fucking 
                        weed.
