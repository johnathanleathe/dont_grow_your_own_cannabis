                    <p> You probably shouldn't grow your own weed. Don't get me wrong, it's a very rewarding experience. 
                        But there's a fair bit of work involved and you're going to have to spend some money to get started. You'll need a bit 
                        of space. Patience will be your only real ally, and you'll have to sort through a lot of incomplete information when 
                        you're looking for answers. Your plants will get sick, some of them will die. And that great smoke that you just can't 
                        wait to light up, well, let's just say that it's probably not gonna happen in a few weeks. Or months. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There are so many good reasons why you should just buy your bud from your guy or the dispensary or anywhere else EXCEPT your own,
                        homegrown stock. Your plants will get sick. They WILL get sick. What sickness, pray tell? Every sickness imaginable. And
                        there are plenty of them. From nutrient dificiencies to tiny little SPIDER MITES (yep, spider mites. Why spiders, you ask?
                        Because they have 8 legs!) to everything else like leaf blight (leaf septoria), problems with your water and probably a lot
                        of other things that I've never even experienced yet. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Feel like solving some of those problems? Great! But before you begin, remember that this plant has been illegal for quite some
                        time, so while we were solving horticultural problems and modernizing our techniques for crop growth and sustainability as a society,
                        your best bet for knowledge about weed is literally a book by uncle Jorge that is a compilation of a lot of first hand (subjective) 
                        knowledge, and a whole heck of a lot of anecdotal information. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It's not about whether or not you have a knack for it. Different forms of life require different types of care. If you've 
                        cared for plants in the past, you'll have a bit of a headstart. But there is still going to be a lot to learn. And 
                        most of that learning is going to be done through trial and error. It's not that there aren't answers out there, but you're
                        going to need to understand the life cycle of the cannabis plant in order to give her the care she needs so that she can 
                        give you those frosty buds. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On the other hand, being there for the birth and growth of your plants, watching those tricomes develop, seeing them grow so
                        quickly and beautifully... well, if you're still with me, I'll give you a few tips so that you don't immediately kill your 
                        plants. If you can fit it into your budget, buy Marijuana Horticulture by Jorge Cervantes. And read it.

                    <p>As is the case with many worthwhile things in life, we begin with some questions. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is your budget?</li>
                                <p class="li-detail">This is an important one. Your budget will determine which type of grow is feasible for your first
                                time around. At minimum you can probably expect to shell out several hundred dollars if you want to have a shot at
                                some decent bud. If you want to get fancy, you could probably spend a grand or two.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Budget whatever amount is comfortable to you, but keep in mind that even under good circumstances it will likely be half
                                a year or more before you are able to enjoy the fruit of your investment. 
                                <br><br>
                                For our purposes, we are going to try to spend the least amount possible to get you growing some solid nugs.
                            <li>How much space do you have?</li>
                                <p class="li-detail">
                                    At minimum you're going to need an area that is 2 feet by 2 feet, with at least 6 feet of ceiling height. Depending
                                    on what and how you would like to grow, you might want a bit more room than that. <br><br>
                                    
                                    If you live in Illinois, for example, you're allowed to grow at home if you are a medical card holder. One requirement 
                                    is that you must cultivate in a room that can be locked and is inaccessible to the public. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Pick a spot you can use for six months.
                                </p>
                            <li>How many plants do you want to grow?</li>
                                <p>In the United States, there are limits to how many plants you can grow in many of the states that have decriminalized or legalized pot. Do your
                                    own research and make sure you're sure before you begin. In Illinois, medical card holders may cultivate five plants that
                                    are over five inches tall. You can either cultivate five at a time from clone or seed to harvest, or you can keep a mother plant and have 
                                    four plants perpetually in the flowering stage. We'll get into that in a bit.
                                </p>
                                
                                <br>
                                
                                <p>You know, this is pretty complicated. Maybe it would be better if you just watched some TV instead.</p>

                    <header>A few words about water</header>
                    <p>Unless you have a particular fetish or phobia where water is concerned, you probably haven't spent
                        that much time thinking about it. Maybe you drink bottled water, or have a filter to take out all
                        the nasty bits. Maybe you've dug a little deeper and decided that you don't like flouride or 
                        chlorine or some other chemical that's been added to stabilize your city water. <br><br>
                        Maybe you live in Flint, Michigan, and all you can think about is water. Or maybe you live at the
                        beach and all you can see is water, but you can't really drink all that much of it. <br><br>
                        Well, none of that really matters. I mean, there is something to be said for drinking the right
                        kind of water and eating the right kind of food. But that's not why we're here. As much as you 
                        may be messing with your own internal chemistry, you have no idea what you are doing to your poor
                        plants when you give them the wrong type of water. What is the wrong type, you ask? Boy, I'm glad
                        you asked! That's a really good question, actually. In fact, I wish I had asked that question
                        before I ever set out upon my ultimately peril-fraught journey of cultivating cannabis. <br><br>
                        Not all water was created equal. There are three basic things that you will have to learn to
                        measure and alter if you have any prayer of becoming a "green thumb":
                        <ol>
                            <li>PH</li>
                            <li>EC (Electric Conducivity) or TDS PPM (Total Dissolved Solids Parts Per Million)</li>
                            <li>Tempurature</li>
                        </ol>
                        People will tell you many things regarding the preceding three items. People will lie to you.
                        The internet will tell you many things as well, and the internet will lie to you as well. I will
                        tell you a few things, and I'll try to be as honest as possible. But hey, let's face it, I'll 
                        probably lie to you as well. If your parents lied to you when you were young and told you that
                        you would do great things with your life, who am I to tell you otherwise?<br><br>
                        I know, I know. You didn't come here to read about your crappy life. You came here so that I
                        could talk you out of growing your own weed. Well, you've come to the right place. Water is
                        another very good reason why you should't grow your own bud. Why? Well, you see those points
                        we enumerated? I wish I could tell you there was an easy, cheap way to find out if your water
                        is worth giving to your plants. But there isn't. You're going to have to spend a minimum of $200
                        dollars on a decent meter, just to keep from killing your plants. People will tell you that you 
                        can spend less. The internet will tell you that you can spend less. But yep, you guessed it. They 
                        would both be lying. 
                        To be fair, you could probably get a TDS meter that could sorta work for less than a hundy, but 
                        I wouldn't recommend it. Consider that your plants will not survive or thrive if you do not give
                        them the water they need in the ranges that they need.<br><br>
                        I could go into a lot more detail here, talking about what sort of meter to buy, what sort of
                        values to look for, what kind of water you need, but what's the point? You probably wouldn't 
                        understand me at this point anyway. If you take anything away from this section, it should be 
                        that water is everything to your plant, yours probably sucks, and making it better is going to
                        cost you. A lot.

                    <header>Lighting</header>
                    <p>This may surprise you, but plants need light to grow. The type and wattage of your lights will
                        have a not inconsiderable effect on how quickly your plants grow and the potency of your crop.<br><br>
                        This is another reason why you shouldn't grow your own weed. If you thought the whole water
                        thing was a lot of money, wait until you start to buy lighting. Even if you find the right kind of
                        lighting for the right price, you're going to continue to pay for that light every single day of your
                        plants' lives. This is one of the big reasons some individuals choose to do their growing outdoors: 
                        you've got a big ball of light in the sky that appears every day at a convenient time and disappears
                        just as conveniently.<br><br>
                        If you can't harness those magical sunbeams, you're going to have to give your plants another light
                        source. Have you ever tried to raise a houseplant like basil or orchids, only to find that they grew
                        slowly and sadly? You're not alone. Even if this has never happened to any other person on the face
                        of the planet, it has happened to yours truly, the author of this here site. So many happy little 
                        plants came through my door, only to grow sad and depressed once the reality of their living conditions
                        set it. I tried. Oh lord, how I tried! I watered them, put them ALMOST directly underneath (though at
                        a respectable distance of at least five feet) one of the 40 watt energy saver bulbs that I have 
                        attempting to brighten up my kitchen. What do you mean that's not enough? What does that even mean?<br><br>
                        As it turns out, plants need more light than that. How much more? Well, remember what we were saying
                        about the Sun? Plants are used to getting light on an order of magnitude somewhere thereabouts, with 
                        all of the color spectrums, heat and intensity that come with it. Trying to feed my basil plant with
                        my puny little kitchen light bulb was like trying to feed my teenage son with scraps left over after
                        his pet rabbit finishes eating: there may be some sort of nutrient content there, but nothing worthwhile.<br><br>
                        Plan on spending another couple hundred dollars AT LEAST on lighting, and a solid 
                    </p>
