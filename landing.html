                    <p> You probably shouldn't grow your own weed. Don't get me wrong, it's a very rewarding experience. 
                        But there's a fair bit of work involved and you're going to have to spend some money to get started. You'll need a bit 
                        of space. Patience will be your only real ally, and you'll have to sort through a lot of incomplete information when 
                        you're looking for answers. Your plants will get sick, some of them will die. And that great smoke that you just can't 
                        wait to light up, well, let's just say that it's probably not gonna happen in a few weeks. Or months. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There are so many good reasons why you should just buy your bud from your guy or the dispensary or anywhere else EXCEPT your own,
                        homegrown stock. Your plants will get sick. They WILL get sick. What sickness, pray tell? Every sickness imaginable. And
                        there are plenty of them. From nutrient dificiencies to tiny little SPIDER MITES (yep, spider mites. Why spiders, you ask?
                        Because they have 8 legs!) to everything else like leaf blight (leaf septoria), problems with your water and probably a lot
                        of other things that I've never even experienced yet. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Feel like solving some of those problems? Great! But before you begin, remember that this plant has been illegal for quite some
                        time, so while we were solving horticultural problems and modernizing our techniques for crop growth and sustainability as a society,
                        your best bet for knowledge about weed is literally a book by uncle Jorge that is a compilation of a lot of first hand (subjective) 
                        knowledge, and a whole heck of a lot of anecdotal information. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It's not about whether or not you have a knack for it. Different forms of life require different types of care. If you've 
                        cared for plants in the past, you'll have a bit of a headstart. But there is still going to be a lot to learn. And 
                        most of that learning is going to be done through trial and error. It's not that there aren't answers out there, but you're
                        going to need to understand the life cycle of the cannabis plant in order to give her the care she needs so that she can 
                        give you those frosty buds. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On the other hand, being there for the birth and growth of your plants, watching those tricomes develop, seeing them grow so
                        quickly and beautifully... well, if you're still with me, I'll give you a few tips so that you don't immediately kill your 
                        plants. If you can fit it into your budget, buy Marijuana Horticulture by Jorge Cervantes. And read it.

                    <header>Where to start</header>
                    
                    <p>As is the case with many worthwhile things in life, we begin with some questions. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is your budget?</li>
                                <p class="li-detail">This is an important one. Your budget will determine which type of grow is feasible for your first
                                time around. At minimum you can probably expect to shell out several hundred dollars if you want to have a shot at
                                some decent bud. If you want to get fancy, you could probably spend a grand or two.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Budget whatever amount is comfortable to you, but keep in mind that even under good circumstances it will likely be half
                                a year or more before you are able to enjoy the fruit of your investment. 
                                <br><br>
                                For our purposes, we are going to try to spend the least amount possible to get you growing some solid nugs.
                            <li>How much space do you have?</li>
                                <p class="li-detail">
                                    At minimum you're going to need an area that is 2 feet by 2 feet, with at least 6 feet of ceiling height. Depending
                                    on what and how you would like to grow, you might want a bit more room than that. <br><br>
                                    
                                    If you live in Illinois, for example, you're allowed to grow at home if you are a medical card holder. One requirement 
                                    is that you must cultivate in a room that can be locked and is inaccessible to the public. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Pick a spot you can use for six months.
                                </p>
                            <li>How many plants do you want to grow?</li>
                                <p>In the United States, there are limits to how many plants you can grow in many of the states that have decriminalized or legalized pot. Do your
                                    own research and make sure you're sure before you begin. In Illinois, medical card holders may cultivate five plants that
                                    are over five inches tall. You can either cultivate five at a time from clone or seed to harvest, or you can keep a mother plant and have 
                                    four plants perpetually in the flowering stage. We'll get into that in a bit.
                                </p>
                                
                                <br>
                                
                                <p>For the purposes of this lesson, and to keep things simple, we're going to create a plan to grow five plants from seed.</p>

                        </ul>
